## Recursive and Iterative

Recursion might be more readable in some cases but requires stack space. Iterative solution in practice can often be
faster.

3. Java TreeMap uses while loops, not recursion.

Not all recursions can be turned into tail recursions, .e.g, quick sort.

## LeetCode Practice Notes

### Java

1. `map.containsKey()` not `map.contains()`

### LeetCode

1. OJ (online judge) does not allow changing method signature. So when discussing throwing an exception, maybe just
   choose to log/print. For example, question 1, two sum, question mentioned can assume exactly one solution but code
   need to return empty result or null in the case no solution is found.

## String and Unicode

- Unicode is a character set, others like ISO-8859, windows 1252 (cp-1252).
- Unicode has 1,114,112 code points, but only characters are assigned to more than 96,000 of them.
- The Unicode code space is divided into 17 planes, each with 65,536 code points.
- Different encodings, like UTF-8 or UTF-16, can encode the same code point as different byte sequences.
- UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII. ASCII characters (U+0000 to U+007F) take 1 byte, code
  points U+0080 to U+07FF take 2 bytes, code points U+0800 to U+FFFF take 3 bytes, code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF take
  4 bytes. Good for English text, not so good for Asian text.
- UTF-16: Variable-width encoding. Code points U+0000 to U+FFFF take 2 bytes, code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF take 4
  bytes. Bad for English text, good for Asian text.
- UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding. All code points take four bytes. An enormous memory hog, but fast to operate on. Rarely
  used.

### Programming Languages

- Internally, Java uses UTF-16.
- Python strings are Unicode by default in Python 3, so they don't have an inherent encoding. Starting from Python 3.15,
  the default encoding for files, stdio, and pipes is UTF-8. This means you don't need to specify the encoding
  explicitly in most cases. `chr()` valid range for the argument is 0 through 1,114,111 (0x10FFFF).

Examples:

| Character | Unicode | UTF-8(hex) | UTF-16(hex) |
|-----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| a         | U+0061  | 61         | 0061        |
| âˆš         | U+221A  | e2 88 9a   | 221a        |
