# Definition

Merriam-Webster defines the noun hash as “chopped meat mixed with potatoes and browned,” hash roughly means “chop and mix”—and that’s precisely where the technical term comes from.

A hash function is a function that maps one piece of data—typically describing some kind of object, often of arbitrary size—to another piece of data, typically an integer, known as hash code, or simply hash.

Hash functions have many uses and for each one, different properties may be desired. There is a type of hash function known as cryptographic hash functions, which must meet a restrictive set of properties and are used for security purposes—including applications such as password protection, integrity checking and fingerprinting of messages, and data corruption detection, among others.

Non-cryptographic hash functions have several uses as well, the most common being their use in hash tables.
