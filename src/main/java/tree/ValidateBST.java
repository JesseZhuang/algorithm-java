/**
 * LeetCode 98, medium, tags: tree, binary tree, dfs, bfs.
 * <p>
 * Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
 * <p>
 * A valid BST is defined as follows:
 * <p>
 * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [2,1,3]
 * Output: true
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
 * -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
