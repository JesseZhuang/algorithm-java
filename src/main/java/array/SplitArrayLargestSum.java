/**
 * LeetCode 410, hard, tags: array, binary search, dynamic programming, greedy, prefix sum.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer k, split nums into k non-empty subarrays such that the largest sum of
 * any subarray is minimized.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimized largest sum of the split.
 * <p>
 * A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
 * Output: 18
 * Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
 * The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
 * The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 106
 * 1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)
