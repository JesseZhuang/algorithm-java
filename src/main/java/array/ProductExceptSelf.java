/**
 * 238. Product of Array Except Self. Medium. Tags: array, prefix sum.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements
 * of nums except nums[i].
 * <p>
 * The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 * <p>
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
 * Output: [24,12,8,6]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
 * Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 2 <= nums.length <= 105
 * -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
 * The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space
 * for space complexity analysis.)
