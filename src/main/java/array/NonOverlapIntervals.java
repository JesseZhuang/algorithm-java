/**
 * LeetCode 435, medium, tags: array, dynamic programming, greedy, sorting.
 * Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi],
 * return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= intervals.length <= 105
 * intervals[i].length == 2
 * -5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
