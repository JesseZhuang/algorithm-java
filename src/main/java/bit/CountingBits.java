/**
 * LeetCode 338, easy, dynamic programming, bit.
 * <p>
 * Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n),
 * ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: [0,1,1]
 * Explanation:
 * 0 --> 0
 * 1 --> 1
 * 2 --> 10
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
 * Explanation:
 * 0 --> 0
 * 1 --> 1
 * 2 --> 10
 * 3 --> 11
 * 4 --> 100
 * 5 --> 101
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 0 <= n <= 105
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Follow up:
 * <p>
 * It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can you do it in linear time O(n)
 * and possibly in a single pass?
 * Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like __builtin_popcount in C++)?
 * Hints:
 * You should make use of what you have produced already.
 * Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.
 * Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?
