 * LeetCode 85, hard, tags: array, stack, monotonic stack.
 * <p>
 * Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1,
 * return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.
 * <p>
 * Example 1: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/histogram.jpg
 * <p>
 * Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
 * The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
 * Example 2: https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/histogram-1.jpg
 * <p>
 * Input: heights = [2,4]
 * Output: 4
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
 * 0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4
