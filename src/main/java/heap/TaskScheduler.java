 * LeetCode 621, medium, tags: array, hash table, greedy, sorting, heap, counting.
 * <p>
 * You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or
 * interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint:
 * identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
 * <p>
 * â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 * <p>
 * Output: 8
 * <p>
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
 * <p>
 * After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd
 * interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
 * <p>
 * Output: 6
 * <p>
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
 * <p>
 * With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
 * <p>
 * Output: 10
 * <p>
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
 * <p>
 * There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice
 * between repetitions of these tasks.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
 * tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
 * 0 <= n <= 100
 * <p>
 * Hint 1
 * There are many different solutions for this problem, including a greedy algorithm.
 * Hint 2
 * For every cycle, find the most frequent letter that can be placed in this cycle. After placing,
 * decrease the frequency of that letter by one.
