/**
 * LeetCode 395, medium, tags: hash table, string, divide and conquer, sliding window.
 * <p>
 * Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of
 * each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.
 * <p>
 * if no such substring exists, return 0.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * s consists of only lowercase English letters.
 * 1 <= k <= 10^5
