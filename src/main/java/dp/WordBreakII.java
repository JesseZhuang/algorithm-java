 * LeetCode 140, hard, tags: array, hash table, string, dynamic programming, backtracking, trie, memoization.
 * <p>
 * Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, add spaces in s to construct a sentence where each word is
 * a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.
 * <p>
 * Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
 * Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
 * Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]
 * Explanation: Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
 * Output: []
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= s.length <= 20
 * 1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 10
 * s and wordDict[i] consist of only lowercase English letters.
 * All the strings of wordDict are unique.
 * Input is generated in a way that the length of the answer doesn't exceed 105.
