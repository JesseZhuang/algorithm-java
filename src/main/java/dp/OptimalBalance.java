/**
 * LeetCode 465, hard, LintCode 707, tags: bit manipulation, array, dynamic programming, backtracking, bit mask.
 * Companies: pinterest, google.
 * <p>
 * You are given an array of transactions where transactions[i] = [from_i, toi, amount_i] indicates that
 * the person with ID = from_i gave amount_i $ to the person with ID = toi.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum number of transactions required to settle the debt.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
 * Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
 * Two transactions are needed. One way to settle the debt is person #1 pays person #0 and #2 $5 each.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: transactions = [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Person #0 gave person #1 $10.
 * Person #1 gave person #0 $1.
 * Person #1 gave person #2 $5.
 * Person #2 gave person #0 $5.
 * Therefore, person #1 only need to give person #0 $4, and all debt is settled.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= transactions.length <= 8, e: O(n^2) (no parallel edges)
 * transactions[i].length == 3
 * 0 <= from_i, to_i < 12, n
 * from_i != to_i
 * 1 <= amount_i <= 100
 * <p>
 * LintCode
 * <p>
 * Given a directed graph where each edge is represented by a tuple, such as [u, v, w] represents an edge with a
 * weight w from u to v.
 * You need to calculate at least the need to add the number of edges to ensure that each point of the weight are
 * balancing. That is, the sum of weight of the edge pointing to this point is equal to the sum of weight of the
 * edge of the point that points to the other point.
 * <p>
 * 1 Note that u â‰  v and w > 0
 * 2 Index may not be linear, e.g. we could have the points 0, 1, 2 or we could also have the points 0, 2, 6
 * 3 A directed graph is a pair of directional graphs that is composed of a set of vertices and a set of directed
 * edges, each of which is connected to an ordered pair of vertices. A graph composed entirely of undirected edges
 * is called an undirected graph
 * <p>
 * Example 1
 * <p>
 * Input: [[0,1,10],[2,0,5]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * Two edges are need to added. There are [1,0,5] and [1,2,5]
 * Example 2
 * <p>
 * Input: [[0,1,10],[1,0,1],[1,2,5],[2,0,5]]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Only one edge need to added. There is [1,0,4]
