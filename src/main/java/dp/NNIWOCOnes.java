/**
 * LeetCode 600, hard, tags: dynamic programming.
 * <p>
 * Given a positive integer n, return the number of the integers in the range [0, n]
 * whose binary representations do not contain consecutive ones.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation:
 * Here are the non-negative integers <= 5 with their corresponding binary representations:
 * 0 : 0
 * 1 : 1
 * 2 : 10
 * 3 : 11
 * 4 : 100
 * 5 : 101
 * Among them, only integer 3 disobeys the rule (two consecutive ones) and the other 5 satisfy the rule.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= n <= 10^9
