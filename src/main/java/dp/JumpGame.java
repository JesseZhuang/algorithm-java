/**
 * LeetCode 55, medium, tags: array, dynamic programming, greedy.
 * You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element
 * in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
 * <p>
 * Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it
 * impossible to reach the last index.
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 104
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 105
