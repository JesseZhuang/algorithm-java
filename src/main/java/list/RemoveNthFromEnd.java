/**
 * LeetCode 19, medium, tags: linked list, two pointers.
 * Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
 * Output: [1,2,3,5]
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: head = [1], n = 1
 * Output: []
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
 * Output: [1]
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * The number of nodes in the list is sz.
 * 1 <= sz <= 30
 * 0 <= Node.val <= 100
 * 1 <= n <= sz
 * <p>
 * Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?
 * Hint1: Maintain two pointers and update one with a delay of n steps.
